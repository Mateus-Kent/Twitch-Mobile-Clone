## 👨‍💻 This project was developed with the following technologies:

### React Native
React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Website: https://reactnative.dev/

### Expo 
Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.

### Typescript 

TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the world’s most used tools, by adding static type definitions. (Official Website)

Website: https://www.typescriptlang.org/

### Styled Components
Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!
